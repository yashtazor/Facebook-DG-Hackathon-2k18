# Hackathon-2k18

A simple scientific calculator with a key lock feature which was made during the Facebook Developer Group Hackathon'18.

##### Why?
So, why did we make this? 

It was simply to allow examination takers to use their phones during the exams to use their phones to use the cauculator instead of buying one. Hence, it promotes reusability and since everyone has a phone these days, no one can even forget bringing it while they may forget bringing a calculator.

##### Drawbacks & Solutions?
It can happen that the person tries to cheat through phone. Hence, we decided to put a keylock feature in the program which would enable the moderator to lock or unlock the phone according to the examination timings. Obviously, a consent has to be given by the applicant before taking the examination.

##### How to run?
1. Just run the Main class.

#### NOTE
Please keep in mind that this is not an actual android app and we didn't use any real-time database for the keylock feature & modeartion. We just delivered a working protocol as soon as we can on a language which was well known by all the team members at the time.
